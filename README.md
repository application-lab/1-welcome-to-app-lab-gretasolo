# About Me
Hallo! My name is Greta. I’m from Lincoln, Nebraska, but currently live in Shanghai, China. I’m a senior studying Interactive Media & Business as well as Social Science. This past school year I was in Berlin in the fall and New York in the spring/summer. 

In Berlin I spent a lot of time exploring the art scene and made my first physical installation for a show in December. I also worked a lot with the Clive Davis students learning how to use a modular synth and music production software. In New York I was meeting all sorts of people and took an ITP class called Sound in Space where I made an 16 channel audio piece using Tone.js that I got to perform at a venue called Future Space. Then, I spent the summer in Brooklyn researching the relationship between artificial and collective intelligence at Governance Lab. 

In my free time I love talking to people, sailing, biking, organizing innovative social events, and trying out new creative projects. Overall, I’m really interested in the intersection between different disciplines. As I continue my studies I hope to learn about varieties of subject areas and types of information that mutually benefit from collaborating with one another but are often kept separate. I’m really curious about the mechanisms working against different disciplines from communicating.
